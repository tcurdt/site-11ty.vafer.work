                <p class="italic">Torsten worked with our Tech, Productive and Creative teams on our iOS app in Gilt Japan in 2013 and the first half of 2014; we launched in July 2014. The app was a huge success; the UX, look-and-feel, and rich native feature-set resonated with our Customers. It also resonated hugely with Apple, who have featured our app in their own marketing materials.
                Torsten is great to work with - he's smart, well-spoken, and knows how to communicate with remote teams. We were thrilled with his commitment and performance. I have no reservations in recommending him as a great partner and engineer for iOS development

                He showed there an incredible dedication and sense of responsibility.
                Hard at work, able to address all kinds of problems and situations, ranging from operations and development to architecture and team leading.
                I highly recommend Torsten. You'll be amazed by what he can achieve.

                <p class="italic">Torsten and I have been collaborating for a number of years on different projects hosted by the Apache Software Foundation, and he has proved himself to a tremendous asset.
                In the past two years I've also been extremely impressed by his leadership and engineering skills while working at Joost, where he leads the analytics data harvesting team: his somehow unorthodox solutions helped simplify dramatically the software stack used to gather analytics data, improving performance and lowering maintenance and deployment times.
                Definitely he is one of the smartest and most experienced Java engineers I've ever had the privilege to work with.

                It was a great pleasure for me to work with someone who has always a great knowledge of what he is working on. He always gave me good advices and considered me as someone who could bring him things as well.

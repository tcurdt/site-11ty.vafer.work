story:
  - "Picture this: You're exploring a remote jungle trail, miles from civilization, when suddenly *snap* - your trusty flip flop breaks. The thin rubber strap that holds everything together has given up, leaving you with a choice: walk barefoot through thorns, mud, and who knows what else, or find a creative solution."
  - "This exact scenario happened to me during a jungle expedition in Costa Rica. As I stood there, one foot bare and vulnerable, I realized how helpless you become when your footwear fails in the middle of nowhere. That's when I knew there had to be a better way."
  - "After that experience, I became obsessed with creating the perfect repair kit - something small enough to carry anywhere, robust enough to handle multiple repairs, and simple enough to use with muddy hands in challenging conditions."
  - "The Flip Flop Fix kit is the result of that obsession. It's not just a repair tool; it's your insurance policy against being stranded barefoot when adventure calls."

faq:
  - question: That's almost the price of new pair! Isn't that a little expensive?
    answer: Think about it this way - will you have a new pair available the exact moment your shoe breaks in the middle of nowhere? This kit is your insurance policy. Plus, it's made in small batches with premium materials, designed to last a lifetime. The environmental benefit of repairing instead of replacing is priceless.
  - question: How many repairs does it last?
    answer: The kit comes with 2 screws total, and you can even re-use screws from previous repairs. The tool itself is built to last a lifetime - I've done hundreds of test repairs with the same tool. It's designed to handle more repairs than flip flops you'll ever own.
  - question: Will it work on all flip flop brands?
    answer: It's specifically designed for Havaianas-style flip flops, but the repair method works on most rubber flip flops with similar strap designs. The kit includes different sized components to handle various strap thicknesses.
  - question: How difficult is it to use?
    answer: It's designed to be simple enough to use with muddy hands in challenging conditions. The video below shows the complete repair process - most people complete a repair in under 5 minutes.
  - question: What about shipping outside Germany/Austria?
    answer: Currently, the 15 EUR price includes shipping to Germany and Austria. For other countries, please email me and I'll calculate the shipping cost based on your location.

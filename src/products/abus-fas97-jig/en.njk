story:
  - "When we decided to upgrade our home security by installing ABUS FAS97 hinge-side security devices on our windows, I was excited about the added protection. These robust security devices are excellent for preventing forced entry through windows. But then I discovered the catch."
  - "The professional drilling jig needed for precise installation costs a whopping 80 EUR. For a one-time home installation project, spending more on the jig than on the actual security hardware seemed absurd. I needed 6 windows secured - that's 80 EUR for a tool I'd use once and then store in a drawer forever."
  - "As an engineer, I knew there had to be a better way. The jig isn't rocket science - it's essentially a precision drilling template that ensures the holes are perfectly aligned. I designed and 3D printed my own version, tested it thoroughly, and achieved the same professional results for a fraction of the cost."
  - "Now you can get the same precision drilling template that I use, saving €65 while still achieving perfect, professional installation of your ABUS FAS97 security hardware."

faq:
  - question: How is this different from the professional 80 EUR jig?
    answer: Functionally, there's no difference - both ensure precise hole positioning for ABUS FAS97 installation. The professional jig is metal and designed for hundreds of installations by professionals. This 3D printed version is perfect for homeowners who need the same precision for a few windows at a fraction of the cost.
  - question: Will this work as well as the expensive version?
    answer: Absolutely. I've tested this design through multiple installations and achieved the same professional results. The key is precise hole positioning, which this jig delivers perfectly. The material is durable enough for typical home use.
  - question: What's included with the jig?
    answer: You get the 3D printed drilling template and 2 mounting screws. That's everything you need to install ABUS FAS97 security hardware with professional precision.
  - question: How many installations can I do with this jig?
    answer: The PETG material is quite durable and should handle 10-20 installations easily - more than enough for most homes. If you're planning commercial use with hundreds of installations, the professional metal jig might be worth the investment.
  - question: Do you also sell the 3D model (STL file)?
    answer: Yes! If you have your own 3D printer, you can buy just the STL file. This is perfect if you want to print multiple jigs or prefer to print it yourself.
  - question: What if I don't have the ABUS FAS97 hardware yet?
    answer: This jig is specifically designed for ABUS FAS97 hinge-side security devices. Make sure you have or plan to purchase the actual ABUS hardware separately - the jig is just the drilling template for precise installation.

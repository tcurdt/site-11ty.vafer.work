story:
  - "The dream was simple: sail around the world with my partner, exploring remote islands and experiencing the freedom that only comes from life at sea. But as I began planning our route, I quickly realized that timing would be everything - the difference between a peaceful crossing and a fight for survival."
  - "Traditional pilot charts show wind patterns and currents, but they don't tell you when and where the really dangerous storms hit. I needed to know: when does hurricane season actually peak in the Caribbean? Which months are safest for crossing the Indian Ocean? Where do the most destructive typhoons form in the Pacific?"
  - "I spent months digging through decades of meteorological data, compiling storm tracks, analyzing patterns, and creating visualizations that would help me understand when to be where. The result was a comprehensive picture of global storm activity that became the foundation of our circumnavigation plan."
  - "What started as personal research became World Storm Charts - a tool that helps sailors and cruisers plan safe routes by understanding historic storm patterns. Because the ocean is beautiful, but it demands respect."

testimonials:
  - quote: Super helpful. Much easier to read than scattered weather data. This helped us plan our Pacific crossing timing perfectly.
    author: Martin E., SV Wild Too
  - quote: I wish we had this earlier. Would have saved us from that nasty blow in the Coral Sea. Essential for any serious cruiser.
    author: Lisa K., SV Wanderer
  - quote: The monthly breakdowns are incredible. Finally, storm data that actually helps with route planning instead of just showing pretty pictures.

faq:
  - question: How is this different from regular pilot charts?
    answer: Pilot charts show wind and current patterns but don't focus specifically on dangerous storms. World Storm Charts compiles decades of actual storm data to show you exactly when and where the most destructive weather occurs, helping you plan your timing to avoid it.
  - question: Are you a meteorologist?
    answer: No, I'm a software engineer and sailor. I'm not selling the raw data (that's publicly available) - I'm selling the hundreds of hours of work that went into compiling, analyzing, and visualizing this data in a way that's actually useful for route planning.
  - question: Can this predict future storms?
    answer: No, this is historical data, not a forecast. Like traditional pilot charts, it shows patterns based on past events to help you understand what to expect. You should always check current weather forecasts before departing.
  - question: What areas are covered?
    answer: Global coverage including Atlantic (hurricanes), Pacific (typhoons/cyclones), Indian Ocean (cyclones), and other major storm-prone regions. Each region is broken down by month showing frequency, intensity, and typical storm tracks.
  - question: Is there a free version?
    answer: Yes! The free version includes 8 pages covering 5, 10, and 100-year visualizations with basic storm frequency and intensity data. The full version adds monthly breakdowns and extends to 30 pages with much more detailed route planning information.
  - question: How do I use this for route planning?
    answer: The charts are organized by region and month, making it easy to see when each area is safest. For example, you can see that the Caribbean is dangerous June-November, while the South Pacific cyclone season runs December-April. Plan your timing accordingly.

          <strong>I am not a meteorologist.</strong> I'm a software engineer and sailor who spent months compiling publicly available historical storm data. What you're buying is the work that went into organizing and visualizing this data, not the raw data itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like traditional pilot charts, this is <strong>historical data, not a forecast.</strong> It shows patterns based on past events to help you understand what to expect, but it cannot predict future storms. Weather has become increasingly unpredictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This data informs your planning, but the final decisions are yours.</strong> Always check current weather forecasts and conditions before departing. I trust my boat and life to the quality of this work, but if you use this data, the responsibility remains with you.

        <p>
          <strong>The goal is to help you stay safe.</strong> Use this data as one tool among many in your route planning toolkit. Combined with current forecasts, local knowledge, and good seamanship, it can help you avoid the worst conditions and enjoy safer passages.

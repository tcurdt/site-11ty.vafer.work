story:
  - "As a developer, I was constantly encountering QR codes in my daily workflow - deployment URLs, API endpoints, authentication tokens, test data, and more. But every time I needed to scan one, I had to pull out my phone, open the camera app, and manually type or share the content back to my Mac. It was inefficient and broke my flow."
  - "I tried several Mac QR code scanners, but they all felt clunky and limited. Most could only decode the QR code and show you the text - but then what? I still had to manually copy it, open the right app, and paste it in. For URLs, I wanted them to open directly in my browser. For text, I wanted it on my clipboard. For certain codes, I wanted to trigger custom actions."
  - "That's when I decided to build ScanCode - a Mac-native QR code scanner that doesn't just decode codes, but actually does something useful with them. It integrates seamlessly with macOS, supporting actions like opening URLs, copying text, launching apps, and even triggering custom workflows."
  - "What started as a personal productivity tool became an essential part of my daily workflow. Whether I'm scanning deployment QR codes, conference WiFi codes, or sharing links between devices, ScanCode makes it effortless and keeps me in the flow."
